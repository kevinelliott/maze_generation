Maze Generation

This repository is simply a sandbox for my exploration in maze generation. I was inspired by Jamis Buck's (jamis) blog
series about maze generation, and this has been something I've wanted to explore for many years. For most of you,
this repository will be uninteresting, but if you're looking to learn a little about how to design mazes then you
might learn a thing or two (I hope!).

As I expect to create bugs, forks and pull requests welcome.
